# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on **LeetCode**. Each solution is organized in individual Java files, covering a range of algorithms and data structures. I use this repository to practice and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Problem List

Below is an index of the problems I have solved so far. You can click on any problem to go directly to its corresponding Java file on GitHub, and I've also added a link to the problem on LeetCode for easy reference.
